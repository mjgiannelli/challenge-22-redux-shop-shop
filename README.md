  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This project was taking an already functional app with a global state created with Context API and refactor the global state to instead be created with Redux

  I created this project to get acquainted with Redux for global state management to increase my development skills.

  Someone will use this app to buy items from an e-commerce website.
